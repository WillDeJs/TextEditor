# TextEditor
My attempt to follow Hecto [tutorial](https://www.philippflenker.com/hecto/) by  Philipp Flenker.

Text editor that runs in the console. Tutorial used as a guideline, different libraries were used. Different code highiliting and line editing approaches were used as well.

Build:
```
cargo run  # to run
cargo build --release # to compile
```
